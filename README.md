# DL-holographic-conductivity
This is the code for deep learning black hole metrics from optical conductivity.  
You can download "the source code" documents and run the manytimes.py code to train the neural network.  
The "training data" documents contain all the input data we used.  
For all the results (.png or .gif or .pdf), we put them together in the "training results" documents.
